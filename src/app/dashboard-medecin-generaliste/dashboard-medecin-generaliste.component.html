            <h2>ü©∫ Modern Hippocratic Oath</h2>
            <p>
              I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:
              <br><br>
              I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk,
              and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.
              <br><br>
              I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required,
              avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.
              <br><br>
              I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science,
              and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist‚Äôs drug.
              <br><br>
              I will not be ashamed to say "I know not," nor will I fail to call in my colleagues
              when the skills of another are needed for a patient‚Äôs recovery.
              <br><br>
              I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know.
              <br><br>
              Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks.
              But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness
              and awareness of my own frailty.
              <br><br>
              I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being,
              whose illness may affect the person‚Äôs family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems,
              if I am to care adequately for the sick.
              <br><br>
              I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.
              <br><br>
              I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings,
              those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.
              <br><br>
              If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter.
              <br><br>
              May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy
              of healing those who seek my help.
